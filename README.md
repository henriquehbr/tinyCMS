# tinyCMS

###### The project is still in early development stage, in case of any bug, please, create a issue on our github repository.

TinyCMS is a stupidly simple content management system, it was developed to be easy to use, robust and as lightweight as possible (actually 16kb) also is powered by a really minimalist and intuitive interface.

## Installation

The installation itself is very simple, just download the tinyCMS.zip file and unzip all the files on your web server or local server (XAMPP) and start using tinyCMS.
